## Code to accompany the paper 'A Lyapunov theory demonstrating a fundamental limit on the speed of systems consolidation'

The code was written and tested in MATLAB R2021a on MacOS. 

To generate the results in Figure 1, set the variables 'SimulMode' and 'perturbCASE' appropriately in mainFig1.m. The MATLAB Simulink enviornment is needed. Now run the script:
>> mainFig1

To generate the neural integrator's simulation results in Figure 4E, run:
>> mainFig4_rel

To generate the Fig 4D, set flipflg=0.
